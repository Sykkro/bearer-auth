# About 
Traefik forward-auth middleware to impersonate kubernetes user/service accounts for authenticated users.

> *WARNING* this is currently in POC phase, so expect things to break or not work at all as you'd expect

Conceptually, this is a simple HTTP server that runs on port 8000 by default and processes user ids via HTTP headers.
The end purpose is to serve as an enrichement middleware chained after `thomseddon/traefik-forward-auth`, mapping `X-Forwarded-User` users to configured impersonations, by sending a (pre-configured, pod-mounted) impersonator bearer token with `Authentication: Bearer <token>` and impersonated account name with `Impersonate-User` in the response HTTP headers.

Please refer to [this file](test/config_reference.yaml) for configuration guidelines.

*Please note:* This is a WIP project and I have zero knowledge in go, being these my very first lines of code in this language.
Feel free to share suggestions or contribute with improvements/some refactoring. ðŸ› 

# Running

Launch with:
```
./main --config=test/test_config.yaml
```

Test user impersonation with:
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080 -H 'X-Forwarded-User: admin@test.example'
```

# Building

```bash
go build main.go
```
